# MCrokeComp490CheckoutCost
This project was created by Molly Croke.  This project calculates a customer's balance at checkout including sales tax. 
The function takes a list of items that the customer is buying and adds them together (including their sales tax) and 
shows the total amount owed. Within the test file, in test_file.py there are the tests I used. It is tested using pytest.
To test the function, you need to create objects that contain the object name, object type, and the object cost. You 
also need to pick the state in which you are shopping in.
